        <h2 class="service-detail-title">Business Branding Foundation</h2>
        <p class="service-detail-tagline">Build the brand identity that makes customers choose you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="service-detail-intro">
        <p>Your business needs more than a logo—it needs a clear, compelling identity that sticks in customers' minds. But too many small businesses operate with generic visuals, inconsistent messaging, and no real understanding of what makes them different.</p>

        <div class="service-callout">
            <span class="service-callout-label">Why you need this:</span>
            <span class="service-callout-text">Customers can't choose you if they can't remember you—or if they don't understand why you're different from everyone else. A scattered brand sends mixed signals and undermines trust before you even get a chance to compete.</span>
        </div>

        <p><span class="service-callout-label">In simple terms:</span> We give your business the strategic foundation that makes customers remember you, trust you, and choose you over the competition.</p>
